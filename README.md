# Telegram bot

## Preparation

You will need this:

* Application for editing Python code, such as [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) (the community edition is both free and capable)
* Heroku account. Sign up for free on [www.heroku.com](https://signup.heroku.com/dc).
* Telegram account. Sign up for free on [telegram.org](https://telegram.org/).
* The Heroku CLI (a tool for deploying applications to Heroku)
* The Heroku Builds plugin for the Heroku CLI

### Install Heroku CLI

First, [install the Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python#set-up) (we use this to manage our Heroku applications)

Second, install the Heroku Builds plugin for the Heroku CLI (we use this to upload our applications to Heroku):
  ```
  heroku plugins:install heroku-builds
  ```

## Step By Step

### Tell Telegram you want to create a bot

Sign in to Telegram and do this:
- Start chatting with the bot BotFather by sending him the message ```/newbot```.
- Answer BotFather's questions.
- After a couple of questions you will get a message starting with "Done! Congratulations...". This message will contain your API key (i.e. the password for your bot).
- Save the API key in a text file on your computer, for later use.

### Get the source code

[Download the Hello World bot source code](https://github.com/mikaelsvensson/helloworld-telegram-chat-bot/archive/master.zip) and extract it to a new folder.

### Create the app in Heroku

Open a terminal window and go to the folder when you extracted the source code.

Run this commands:
```
heroku apps:create
heroku ps:scale web=1 --app NAME_OF_YOUR_HEROKU_APPLICATION
```

You will now see something like this:

    Creating app... done, ⬢ powerful-everglades-32132
    https://powerful-everglades-32132.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/powerful-everglades-32132.git
    
In the above example, the application's name is _powerful-everglades-32132_. You will see another name, and that is your app's name, which you should use instead of ```NAME_OF_YOUR_HEROKU_APPLICATION``` further down in this tutorial. Additionally, the application's address is https://powerful-everglades-32132.herokuapp.com. 
    
Make your API key, sent to you by BotFather, available to your Heroku application by entering this command in your terminal:

```
heroku config:set TELEGRAM_BOT_APIKEY=your-bot-api-key --app NAME_OF_YOUR_HEROKU_APPLICATION
```

### Get it working

Open `init_webhook.py` and set the ```HOST_NAME``` constant to the app's address. Skip the ```/``` at the end. It should look something like this:

    HOST_NAME = 'https://powerful-everglades-32132.herokuapp.com'

Deploy to Heroku using this command:

```
heroku builds:create --app NAME_OF_YOUR_HEROKU_APPLICATION
```

Start chatting with your bot. You should now be able to find your bot in Telegram by searching for it using the name you sent to BotFather earlier. 

Verify that it sends back everything you send to it.

**You now have a fully functional bot! Congratulations!**

## Next steps

In `app/views.py` there is a function called `process_text`. Use that to change the text and make the bot smarter.

If you want something to get you started you can try these [ideas on chat bots](./bots-ideas.md).

Remember to run this command after you change something, otherwise the bot will not see your changes: 

```
heroku builds:create --app NAME_OF_YOUR_HEROKU_APPLICATION
```
